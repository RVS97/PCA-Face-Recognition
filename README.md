### Code Instructions

The task of face recognition is performed using various variations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

All of the implementations are executed from the [Init.py](https://github.com/RVS97/PCA-Face-Recognition/blob/master/Init.py) file. Uncomment and comment the desired part accordingly to use each different method. 

[facesClasses.py](https://github.com/RVS97/PCA-Face-Recognition/blob/master/facesClasses.py) : Class to deal with faces dataset and the simpler PCA operations.

[PCALDA.py](https://github.com/RVS97/PCA-Face-Recognition/blob/master/PCALDA.py) : Class with Linear Discriminant Analysis implementation on top of PCA for face recognition.

[Ensemble.py]() : Class with ensemble apporach implementation on top of PCA-LDA for face recognition.
